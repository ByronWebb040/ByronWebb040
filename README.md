- 👋 Hi, I’m @ByronWebb040
- 👀 I’m interested in thrill activities such as skydiving,bunji jumping,and hand gliding

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how the hell to keep ahaid at the dish tank during large events by myself since plates,coffee cups,glasses,and utensils are a new thing at the dish tank.not to mention additional requests from other staff members like taking trash out,or sweeping their areas floor,or cleaning out their cooking tools (kettle,flat grill,etc)and their floor drain,not leaving out breaking down boxes and disposing of them.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of the issues that I have listed in the above statement.and I could have a solution to one or all of the above if teamwork came into play.im only one man juggling individual tasks that can very well be addressed without time loss 

- 📫 How to reach me is easy,being that these issues are in my work space that I share with a whole team,just come to me and ask me what are my feelings on these issues and how I propose the way to settle a given task,and I will be glad to share my info.only no one thinks about me getting more behind on my job or duty that I was hired to do.i don't even think anyone cares as long as they can leave at a decent time,because I have been there trying to finish my duties,only to look around and everyone has left me alone to finish myself.
